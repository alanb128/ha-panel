A wall mounted control panel for Home Assistant, as seen in this video: https://youtu.be/Oz87wOJSQm8. 

This repository contains all of the files for the working unit (or will in time.) However, this is not a tutorial or kit - this is mainly a template and provided as inspiration for others wanting to make a similar panel. Feel free to use or modify these files, which are provided as-is and without support. 

## STL Files

The STL files for the five panels are in the STL folder. The sixth panel is the Pi 7" touch screen assembly. See the layout image below:

The frame is called a "[Floater Frame](https://framing4yourself.com/product/matte-black-floater-frame-20101-m/)" and for this project is 9.25 inches x 15.75 inches.
